## Data as provided from the OnoriLab at Stanford.

### Dataset 01

Data for constant current discharge tests at C-rates of [0.05C, 1C, 2C, 3C, 5C] for six cells and three different temperatures.
The folder also contains the technical specifications sheet of the cell and a README file to briefly describe the dataset.

### Dataset 02

Data for HPPC, UDDS, and US06 discharge experiments conducted at T=25degC. Data may not be available for ALL six cells. For some cells, if their voltage breaches the voltage threshold limits, the experiments are stopped. Hence, data pertaining to those cells are not included in this dataset.


1) Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) -> As defined by the US Department of Energy manual with data acquisition at sampling time of 1second.

2) Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) -> A real-world driving profile for a charge-depleting Electric Vehicle with data acquisition at sampling time of 0.1 second.

3) US06 -> A real-world driving profile for a charge-sustaining Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) with data acquisition at sampling time of 0.1second. [This profile starts in the mid-SOC region]
